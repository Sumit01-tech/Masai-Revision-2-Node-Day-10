# Day 10: MongoDB Fundamentals

## Theoretical Questions

### 1. What is MongoDB? What makes it different from relational databases?

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. Unlike relational databases, it does not use tables, rows, or fixed schemas and avoids joins by storing related data together.

---

### 2. What are collections and documents in MongoDB?

* **Document:** A single record stored as a BSON object (similar to JSON).
* **Collection:** A group of documents, similar to a table in relational databases.

---

### 3. What is BSON? How does it differ from JSON?

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded format used by MongoDB to store documents. It supports additional data types like Date and Binary and is faster to parse than JSON.

---

### 4. Explain the structure of a MongoDB document. What is _id?

A MongoDB document is a key-value structure stored in BSON format. The **_id** field is a unique identifier automatically generated by MongoDB to uniquely identify each document in a collection.

---

### 5. What are the data types supported in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports String, Number (Int, Double, Long), Boolean, Array, Object, Date, ObjectId, Null, Binary Data, and Decimal128.

---

### 6. What are embedded documents vs references in MongoDB?

* **Embedded documents:** Store related data inside a single document.
* **References:** Store relationships using ObjectId references to other documents.

---

### 7. When should you embed vs reference data?

Embed data when it is frequently accessed together and has a one-to-few relationship. Use references when data is large, frequently updated, or shared across multiple documents.

---

### 8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of MongoDB?

**Advantages:** Flexible schema, high scalability, fast reads/writes, easy horizontal scaling.

**Disadvantages:** Limited joins, higher memory usage, weaker transaction support compared to relational databases.

---

### 9. Explain schema design in MongoDB. Is MongoDB schema-less?

MongoDB is schema-flexible, not schema-less. Documents in a collection can have different structures, but schema design is still important for consistency and performance.

---

### 10. What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data processing where documents pass through multiple stages such as $match, $group, $sort, and $project to transform and analyze data.
